**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Grade:** High First (88%)

## Overview

This project was developed as part of my EC331 dissertation module at the University of Warwick. The dissertation, titled "Searching For Nash At Monte Carlo: Approximating Optimal Strategies For Five-Card Draw Poker," explores the construction of an optimal poker-playing program by approximating the Nash equilibrium using Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR). The project was awarded a high first, with a mark of 88%.

The project includes the creation of a program that approximates the Nash equilibrium for Five-Card Draw Poker and its evaluation against various models of human poker-playing behavior, considering factors such as agent-modelling, deception, risk management, and unreliable information.
